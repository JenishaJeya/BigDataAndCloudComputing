# BigDataAndCloudComputing

Theoretical Task:
Cloud Migration Benefits: Explain the key advantages of migrating to the Cloud for an international company with global offices, focusing on aspects such as location, types of cloud services, and costs.
Cloud Provider Solutions: Propose a solution for migrating from an in-premise setup to cloud providers like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. Compare IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) options, analyzing advantages and disadvantages.
Handling Big Data Challenges: Consider how the company could handle the growth to 1,000,000,000 customers globally, and how Big Data can support operations. Identify challenges and solutions using Big Data technologies.
Practical Task:
Dataset Selection and Description: Find a suitable dataset (numerical or nominal) for classification problems, and provide a detailed description. Available datasets can be sourced from UCI or Kaggle.

Sub-task 1: Perform exploratory data analysis using tools like Python, Weka, or SQL to calculate basic statistics (min, max, average, etc.) for selected attributes.
Sub-task 2: Migrate data to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, describe the data migration process, and compare with SQL-based operations.
Sub-task 3: Use a classification method (like Neural Networks and K-NN models) on one feature in your dataset and analyze its accuracy, considering feature correlations.
